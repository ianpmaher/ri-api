# RI API 
Rhode Island as a Unit of Measurement | Measure any quantity in terms of Rhode Island. 


# Functional deployment: 


# Details: 
* What is more American than looking at the world in terms of America itself? The Rhode Island API solves a problem few of us have ever considered: how many Rhode Islands would fit into this body of water? How large is this iceberg, in terms of Rhode Islands? How many people live in Indonesia, in units of Rhode Island? (That last one is about 267.)
* Call to action: developers, take this API and paint the world in terms of Rhode Island, Little Rhodey, the Ocean State.
